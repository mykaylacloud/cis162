<header><h2>About Me</h2></header>
<p>Hello, my name is Mykayla Richards. I am the middle child of four siblings. I have obtained a previous degree within Geospatial Criminology and wanted to gain more skills. This is why I am majoring in Cybersecurity at Cerritos. I currently work at the Department of Homeland Security as a TSA officer. I hope to further my career in the federal tech industry and gain more knowledge on building and making a website.</p>
